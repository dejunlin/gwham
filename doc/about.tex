\section{About this document}
This document describes the theory and implementation of a generalized version
of Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM).  Section~\ref{sec:intro}
describes what types of problem WHAM can solve and section~\ref{sec:theory}
describes how WHAM solve these problems.  Section~\ref{sec:impl} describes my
C++ implementation of WHAM and section~\ref{sec:usage} describes how to use
this implementation.  All users are strongly encouraged to read carefully and
understand this documentation before using the software. The software is under

from Numerical Recipes~\cite{NumRec2007}.
